# Fibonacci-series-generation-using-RISC-V-single-cycle
This is Verilog program which has been done as a term project. The program has been designed to emulate a RISC V single cycle processor.
The data path and control path diagram are shown in the figure below.

After running the program on Iverilog, it was implemented on the Vivado software and finally it was mapped to the Basys 3 FPGA board. The 
output for the same was seen using the seven segment display.

Here the final RISC V code and the seven segment display code are attached. 
The data path and control path diagrams are also attached.

Those are the reference needed to implement the code.
